    <string name="appletart_recipe">
        Ingredients:\n
        1. 1 1/4 cups all purpose flour\n
        2. 1/4 cup powdered sugar\n
        3. 1/2 teaspoon salt\n
        4. 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter cubed\n
        5. 1 egg yolk\n
        6. 2 to 3 tablespoons water\n
        7. 3 to 4 apples\n
        8. 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted)\n
        9. 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n
        10. 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n
        11. 4 tablespoons melted apricot jam\n

        Instructions:\n
        For the crust:\n
        1. In a food processor, add flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter. Pulse 4 to 5 times or until the butter is in pea-sized pieces.\n
        2. Whisk the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of water together. While pulsing, slowly add the wet mixture into the food processor. Pulse until a crumbly dough forms and is wet enough to hold together well when squeezed.\n
        3. Transfer to dough a floured surface and knead a few times until it comes together in a ball. Flouring your surface and rolling pin well, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Roll the dough up around the rolling pin to transfer it to the tart pan. Unroll the dough over the pan and press into the bottom and sides. Use a sharp knife to cut off the excess dough.\n
        4. Freeze until solid, about 45 minutes. (Crust can be frozen for up to 2 days.)\n
        5. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400F. Line the tart crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights. Place on a rimmed baking sheet.\n
        6. Bake for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the paper and weights. Let cool\n

        For the filling:\n
        1. Reduce oven temperature to 350F.\n
        2. Peel the apples and core them by standing the apple up onto its stem end and cutting the apple around the core, creating pieces with flat bottoms. Thinly slice the apple pieces into half-moons.\n
        3. In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cinnamon-sugar over the bottom of the tart crust.\n
        4. Arrange the apples in the frozen tart shell by placing groups of slices in the shell, flat sides down, and gently pushing them in one direction to create a shingled effect. Drizzle with melted butter. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon-sugar all over the apples\n
        5. Bake for 45 minutes or until the apples are very bubbly. Brush the apples with the melted jam. Let cool completely before removing the tart from the pan.\n

    <string name="kaiserschmarrn_recipe">
        Ingredients:\n
        1. 1/4 cup raisins\n
        2. 2 tablespoons rum or water, if using raisins\n
        3. 4 medium-sized eggs\n
        4. 1/3 cup sugar\n
        5. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n
        6. a pinch of salt\n
        7. 1 cup flour\n
        8. 1 cup milk\n
        9. 2 1/2 tablespoons butter\n
        10. powdered sugar and/or plum jam, to garnish\n

        Instructions:\n
        1. If you want to include raisins into your recipe, soak them for around 15-30 minutes in 2 tablespoons of rum. If you don’t like rum and/or are sharing this meal with kids, just use water instead.\n
        2. Separate the eggs – egg yolks into a large mixing bowl and egg whites into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Make sure that no egg yolk gets into the egg whites as this would make it harder to beat the egg whites in the next step.\n
        3. Beat the egg whites in their bowl for a few minutes until stiff. When tilting the bowl, the egg whites should barely move/slide. Another way to test that the egg whites are stiff enough is to raise your beaters. If the egg whites create a little "mountain" in the bowl, your egg whites are stiff enough.\n
        4. In the bowl with the egg yolks, add sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat with your electric mixer until the batter is smooth.\n
        5. Add in the milk and the flour interchangeably into the egg yolk mixture in small increments while beating the batter on the lowest setting.\n
        6. Set your electric mixer aside and carefully fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture with a spatula. Also add the raisins (optional).\n
        7. Heat butter in a large frying pan and pour the batter in. If you have a smaller pan, you might want to fry the batter in two batches. We usually use a pan with a 10-inch diameter and prefer to fry it in two intervals as it makes it easier to flip and rip. Fry the pancake on low-medium heat for around 5 minutes until the bottom is slightly golden brown.\n
        9. Break/rip your pancake into a couple of big pieces with a spatula and flip. The top of the pancake might still be uncooked which is fine – it will cook quickly once flipped. After flipping the pancake wait for around 2 minutes for it to cook lightly, then start ripping the pancake into even smaller pieces. Keep moving the pieces until everything is golden brown and fully cooked through.\n
        10. Plate your pieces and serve your pancake with powdered sugar, plum jam, or apple sauce.\n

    <string name="keylimepie_recipe">
        Ingredients:\n
        1. 4 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)\n
        2. 8.8 oz biscoff cookies(graham crackers)\n
        3. 21 ounces sweetened condensed milk\n
        4. 2/3 cup key lime juice\n
        5. 3 egg yolks\n
        6. 2 tsp lime zest\n

        Instructions:\n
        1. Heat oven to 350F. Add the cookies to a food processor and pulse until you have fine crumbs. Drizzle in the melted butter and pulse until combined. If you dont have a processor handy you could instead use a plastic bag and rolling pin, then just mix the crumbs and butter in a large bowl\n
        2. Dump the mixture into a 9" pie dish then distribute and use a flat-bottomed glass or measuring cup to press the crumbs firmly down. You can use your fingers to press the top down as the side Is compressed.\n
        3. Bake crust at 350F for 10 minutes.\n
        4. While the crust Is baking zest two limes and set aside then squeeze 2/3 cup of juice and strain out the seeds.\n
        5. Add the egg yolks and zest to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat for a minute or so.\n
        6. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk and mix on medium until fully incorporated then scrape the bowl down and pour in the key lime juice while the mixer runs on low. Scrape the bowl down once more and mix.\n
        7. Pour the filling into the warm crust and give it a jiggle to level things out. Bake at 350F for about 10 minutes then cool on a wire rack for about 20 minutes and chill for at least an hour. Youll see some tiny holes in the pie and it will jiggle slightly when its done baking.\n
        8. Top the pie with dollops of whipped cream and serve.\n

    <string name="lemonbar_recipe">
        Ingredients:\n
        1. 3 cups all purpose flour\n
        2. 2/3 cups powdered sugar\n
        3. 1/2 tsp salt\n
        4. 12 tbsp unsalted butter(melted)\n
        5. 3 tbsp lemon zest\n
        6. 3 cups sugar\n
        7. 8 eggs\n
        8. 1 cup lemon juice\n

        Instructions:\n
        1. Heat oven to 350F and line a 9x13 baking dish with parchment paper.\n
        2. Whisk together 2 1/2 cups of flour (300g) with the powdered sugar and salt, then pour in the melted butter and mix until combined. You can also do this using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. If youd like a dash of vanilla can be added in with the butter at this step.\n
        3. Sprinkle the dough into your lined pan and press down into a flat layer. Bake at 350F for about 20 minutes or until a light golden color.\n
        4. While the crust is baking add the sugar to a food processor and add the zest of three lemons. Pulse until the zest is fully incorporated and sugar is a light yellow color. If you dont have a processor just mince the zest and mix with the sugar in a bag or bowl.\n
        5. Add the sugar and remaining half cup of flour to a large bowl and mix well. You can sift together however and zesty sugar bits will need to get dumped out of the sifter as they might clog things up and not go through.\n
        6. Pour in the lemon juice and add the eggs then mix very well until completely combined.\n
        7. Pour the filling onto the warm crust then transfer to oven and bake for about 25 minutes, turning halfway through the bake. Remove from oven and allow to cool for an hour before chilling in the refrigerator for two hours.\n
        8. Dust with powdered sugar and cut into bars using a clean, sharp, damp knife. Clean and re-wet the knife after each cut.\n
